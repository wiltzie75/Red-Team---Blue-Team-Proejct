# Red Team / Blue Team Proejct
This is a Red Team / Blue Team project that was composed of three parts.  The first part I acted as the Red Team and was tasked with gaining access to a webserver.  The second part I acted as the Blue Team to analyzed the Red Team attack.  I used Kibana and the metricbeat, filebeat and packetbeat packages
